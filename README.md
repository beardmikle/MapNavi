# MapNavi 📍🗺️
-----------------


The application was developed as part of the study of the MapKit and CoreLocation frameworks.
The construction of the route is carried out at three characteristic addresses.
After adding three characteristic points (addresses), two additional buttons appear to the already existing button "Add address".
The first additional button is responsible for building a route.
When you click on it, the route is drawn and the path is highlighted with a blue trajectory.
The second additional button is responsible for erasing the previously entered data.
After erasing the entered data, the route is re-constructed at the three specified addresses.

Pop-up alerts have also been added.
